# ðŸ‘‹ Hey Ajay and Noah!

Here's a quick explanation of the files in this directory:
- [project_proposal.md](/project_proposal.md/) - this one is self explanitory!
- [sample_ecdna_x](/sample_ecdna_x.png/) - what all of the input images of ecDNA look like
- [sample_ecdna_y](/sample_ecdna_x.png/) - what I want the output images to look like (this one is just randomly placed dots, but the real ones should look something like this)
- [u_net_architecture.jpg](/u_net_architecture.jpg/) - my diagram of the model I am using: a convolutional neural network complete with convolutional layers, max pools, and up sampling. Takes in and returns a 2028x2028 image
