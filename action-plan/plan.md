# Action Plan

### Month 1
**Goal**: Create the first draft of the model (a cnn to locate ecDNA from imagry). Currently, I have about 70% completed, with a working (but basic) CNN. I would like to have a model ready for testing by the end of the month

**Tasks**: I have to finish formatting the data so that it is the correct size, apply some transforms to artificially inflate the data set, and create tensor representations of the location of each piece of ecDNA (currently, the center point of each is in a text file. I need to expand these single points into small circles to the model is better able to learn).
